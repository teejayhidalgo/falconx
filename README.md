Notes:

Backend
* Initially I used the customizer to make the contents dynamic, but after studying block patterns I just created blocks for the contents
* I kept the customizer class to make the nav button colors and text dynamic, pls see "Nav Button Customizer"
* I created custom blocks for each section, divided into 2 categories "cover", "columns". It is working but when column is selected from dropdown the section shakes, I did not have time to fix.
* Nav menus are linked by using custom menu on the menu manager, and anchor or the advance properties of the blocks

Frontend

* I was not able to implement mobile responsiveness
* I was not able to finish styling the website
* I was not able to use the correct fonts
